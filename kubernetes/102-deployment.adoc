= 102 - Deploying applications on Kubernetes

The interactive shell container is useful for test situations, but that is not what Kubernetes excels at.
Kubernetes is great at running stateless web services and apps for long periods.

IMPORTANT: We are going to deploy images using Java 17. Make sure your installed JDK is Java 17:
[source, bash]
----
$ java --version
openjdk 17.0.4 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8, mixed mode)
$ javac --version
javac 17.0.4
----

== Deploying the first application

In this section, we will deploy the first Java application on Kubernetes.

=== Getting Started

On your computer, clone the https://github.com/cescoffier/kubernetes-workshop[cescoffier/kubernetes-workshop] Git repository and navigate in the `kubernetes/first-service` directory:

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/cescoffier/kubernetes-workshop.git
Cloning into 'kubernetes-workshop'...
...

$ cd kubernetes-workshop/kubernetes/first-service
----

The `first-service` project is a typical looking microservice project written in Java.
It uses https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] as a framework, but any other Java framework would be similar.

The repository contains `Dockerfiles` located in the `src/main/docker` directory.
 
The business logic is not very relevant or interesting. 
It just prints a simple message containing the `HOSTNAME` and the current date.

The `kubernetes` directory will contain the kubernetes descriptors.

Before going further, build the application with:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package
----
  
=== Deployment

If you're using Minikube from the previous tutorial, then ensure your current terminal session is configured to use the Minikube Docker daemon by running the below command:

[source, bash]
----
# On Linux and Mac:
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)

# On Windows:
> minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression

----

Next, run `docker build` and wait for it to complete:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t workshop/first-service-jvm .
----

Next, we're going to create a Deployment manifest, which Kubernetes uses to control scheduling and running your containerized service in a Pod. 
Create a new file `kubernetes/deployment.yaml` with the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: first-service
  labels:
    app: first-service
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: first-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: first-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: first-service
        image: workshop/first-service-jvm:latest        
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent          
----

The descriptor is written using the YAML format. 
It describes the `first-service` deployment, which, once deployed, instructs Kubernetes to creates two replicas of our container. 

A deployment is a way of telling the Kubernetes scheduler enough about the thing being deployed so that it can schedule work on Kubernetes nodes, handle upgrades, and scale the underlying pods. 
The above deployment will result in two running single-container pods, which means two separate instances of `first-application` will be running.

The deployment also exposes the port 8080.
The `imagePullPolicy` indicates to Kubernetes to not pull the image from a container registry is already available, which in our case is what we want. 
Remember, we are using the Docker daemon from minikube, so when we built the image, it went to that daemon.
So, the image is already available.

The _labels_ and _selectors_ are used to recognize from where comes the various objects that will be created by Kubernetes.

Run the below `kubectl` command to configure Kubernetes:


[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
deployment.apps/first-service created
----

The output indicates the configuration was accepted and is being acted upon by the cluster.
You can inspect the status of the deployment using the below `kubectl` command:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get deployment/first-service

NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
first-service    2/2     2            2           4m20s
----

If the count of `Available` is equal to `2` then that means the application is successfully running, but you are probably wondering how to access the deployed application. 
There is no convenient way to talk to the running `first-service` instances as it stands right now. 
We need to create a Kubernetes Service that can route traffic to the backend pods to talk to them.

=== Service

Kubernetes has a resource called a "service" which is a DNS resolvable endpoint that acts as a proxy to a set of containers. 
There are several types of Services in Kubernetes, but for now, we are going to focus solely on the `LoadBalancer` type. 
A `LoadBalancer` service creates a public endpoint that you can access over the public network. 
The mechanism by which it does this is different depending on where your Kubernetes cluster is running; for example, on Amazon Web Services ("AWS") if you create a `LoadBalancer` then Kubernetes knows how to talk to AWS and provision an Elastic Load Balancer. 
However, if you are running in Minikube then Kubernetes knows it cannot create an Elastic Load Balancer and does something different.

On your computer create a new file `kubernetes/service.yaml`, with the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: first-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: first-service
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: http
----

Once again, run the now familiar `kubectl apply` command on your computer:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
deployment.apps/first-service configured
service/first-service created
----

Once you run that command, Kubernetes will immediately work to fulfill the request. 
You can check the status of the service with the following command. 
However, an important thing to know is that on Minikube the `EXTERNAL-IP` field will always be `<pending>`:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get service/first-service

NAME               CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
first-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.237.153   <pending>     8080:30743/TCP   26s
----

On Minikube to get the address of the service, you can use the below command, which will return the address:

[source, bash]
----
$ minikube service first-service --url
üèÉ  Starting tunnel for service first-service.
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |     NAME      | TARGET PORT |          URL           |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| default   | first-service |             | http://127.0.0.1:63827 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
http://127.0.0.1:63827
‚ùó  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.
----

NOTE: Depending on your operating system and installation, the previous command may block, and the service would only be available while running.

To test out your service, you can combine this with something such as `curl`; for example, try running the following command from a `bash` shell (replace the URL part) multiple times:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:63827
----

You should see the response from each instance of your running application. 
For example, given this output:

[source, bash]
----
hello from first-service-5696c74bc8-nqdkj, it is 2020-11-22 10:28:05                                                                                              
hello from first-service-5696c74bc8-nqdkj, it is 2020-11-22 10:28:06
hello from first-service-5696c74bc8-5kc2p, it is 2020-11-22 10:28:07
----

You can see that the `hostname` is changing, which corresponds to the pods running based on the earlier deployment.

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods --selector='app=first-service'

NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
first-service-5696c74bc8-5kc2p    1/1     Running   0          9m10s
first-service-5696c74bc8-nqdkj    1/1     Running   0          9m7s
----

=== Repository layout

Note that our first Kubernetes service consists of three key components: 

* The application source
* A `Dockerfile` to create a container image - it specified how the application is containerized
* One or more Kubernetes descriptor files that determine how the service is deployed.

In general, these files should all be stored in the same GitHub repository for the service.
This is different from the typical monolithic repo structure, where the deployment configuration is stored in a separate repository (e.g., an Ansible playbook that is maintained by operations).

Group your Kubernetes manifests (e.g. ` deployment.yaml`) with your service implementation. 
It makes it easy to deploy later on and keeps the project configuration local to the code, so they stay in sync. 
It also creates a convention for other services to do the same thing and allows further tooling to be layered on top.

=== Exercises

1. What if you want to modify the number of deployed replicas of Hello Kubernetes? 
In `deployment.yaml` update the `replicas` field to 1 and then run `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml` and see what happens.

=== Takeaways

* A `Deployment` is a configuration construct that allows you to run many containers.
* A `Service` allows you to expose a `Deployment` externally.


== The first step toward microservices

Microservice applications are composed of many cooperatively communicating services. 
In this section, you will learn how easy it is to connect one service to another. 
We will update the first service from the previous section to use another service that runs in the same Kubernetes cluster.

=== The Second Service

The new service is a _quote service_.
It returns a random quote (from the pirate universe).

On your computer, in a terminal, navigate to the `kubernetes/second-service` directory.

This project's layout should be familiar as it the same as `first-service` with `Dockerfiles` and the `kubernetes` directory.

Create the `kubernetes/deployment.yaml` following the same structure as the one used for the `first-service`.
Don't forget to update the labels, selector and image.

Then, create the `kubernetes/service.yaml` file with the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: second-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: second-service
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: http
----

The most essential piece of information in this service descriptor is the `type: ClusterIP`.
We saw a `type: LoadBalancer` service in the first service, which exposed an external IP address to access the pods. 
Kubernetes offers several types of services, and one of the most common is `ClusterIP`.
The `ClusterIP` type creates a service that does not have an external IP address, which means the service can only be accessed from inside the cluster.
The `ClusterIP` service type is widespread for backend services that do not need to be accessed in any way except other consumers in the same cluster. 

To deploy the service run the familiar `kubectl apply` command on your computer:

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn package
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t workshop/second-service-jvm .
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
deployment "second-service" created
service "second-service" created
----

Once you run that command, Kubernetes will immediately work to fulfill the request. 
You can check the status of the service with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get service/second-service
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
second-service   ClusterIP   10.101.32.105   <none>        8080/TCP   8m51s
----

Kubernetes did not assign an externally accessible address because of the `ClusterIP` type. That is precisely the outcome we want because this second service is intended to be used as a backend service for the previous first service application should not be exposed outside the cluster.

=== Testing the second service

As said above, the service is not exposed. 
So how can we test it?
As we did in the previous workshop, we can connect to the pod and run a few `curl` commands.

First, get the name of the pod:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
first-service-5696c74bc8-5kc2p    1/1     Running   1          26h
first-service-5696c74bc8-nqdkj    1/1     Running   1          26h
second-service-7dcd577fb6-r9q8k   1/1     Running   1          23h
second-service-7dcd577fb6-sdjkn   1/1     Running   1          23h
----

Pick the name of a pod belonging to the second-service deployment, for example, _second-service-7dcd577fb6-r9q8k_.
Then, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty  second-service-7dcd577fb6-r9q8k -- /bin/bash
----

Replace the name of the pod to match yours.

Then, once connected, run:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/quote
Avast ye landlubbers! Ye can throw ye lunch in Davy Jones‚Äô locker, but not yer homework!
$ curl http://localhost:8080/quote
Piracy ‚Äì Hostile take over. Without the messy paperwork.
$ exit
----

If it prints quotes, it works!

=== Calling the second service from the first service

For the next few steps, open another command line terminal, then enter into the directory where you have the code of the first service.

[source, bash]
----
$ cd ../first-service
----

Edit the `pom.xml` file and add the following dependencies:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-rest-client-reactive-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Update the code to talk to the second service.
In your IDE, create the `src/main/java/me/escoffier/workshop/SecondServiceClient.java` file with the following content:

[source, java]
----
package me.escoffier.workshop;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "second-service")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public interface SecondServiceClient {

    @Path("/quote")
    @GET
    String getQuote();

    @Path("/crash")
    @GET
    String crash();

}
----

This class is a Microprofile Rest client, an easy way to interact with another service using HTTP without dealing with the low-level aspects of the protocol.

NOTE: The `crash` method will be used in the next chapter.

Then, open the `src/main/java/me/escoffier/workshop/MyFirstResource.java`, and update the content to become:

[source, java]
----
package me.escoffier.workshop;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RestClient;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import java.util.Calendar;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;

@Path("/")
public class MyFirstResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String print() {      
        return "hello from " + System.getenv("HOSTNAME") + ", it's " + now();
    }

    public static final String DATE_FORMAT_NOW = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss";

    public static String now() {
        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
        SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT_NOW);
        return sdf.format(cal.getTime());
    }

    // --- To be added in 1.0.2 - second service ---

    @Inject @RestClient SecondServiceClient client;

    @GET
    @Path("/quote")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String printWithQuote() {
        return "hello from " + System.getenv("HOSTNAME") + ", " + client.getQuote();
    }
}
----

The new code provides a second endpoint ("/quote"), which prints the _hello_ message followed with a quote, retrieved from the second service.

Build the service using:

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

=== Updating the first service

In the new `/quote` URL implementation, you just wrote the method call to the second service.
Behind the scene, the Rest Client will call the second service. 
The url is configured in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source, text]
----
second-service/mp-rest/url=http://second-service:8080
----

As you can see, it uses the `second-service` name, which is the Kubernetes service name. 
Kubernetes uses an internal DNS server to handle service discovery for your applications.
You can refer to the previously deployed service by attempting to connect to a named host. 
In Kubernetes, discovering services is as simple as referring to them by `${SERVICE_NAME}` because there is a built-in DNS service in Kubernetes. 
While not shown here, if you were isolating services via Kubernetes Namespace functionality, the DNS name would be `${SERVICE_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}`.

Time to deploy then test out the new functionality.

Next, rebuild the Docker image for the modified Hello Kubernetes service.

[source, bash]
----
# Be sure to be in the first-service directory
# Be sure you use the Docker daemon from minikube
$ docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t workshop/first-service-jvm:1.1 .
----

Afterward, open the Hello Kubernetes deployment manifest and find the line `image: workshop/first-service-jvm:latest`. Update the line to refer to be `image: workshop/first-service-jvm:1.1`.

Finally, save the file and then run `kubectl apply`:

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

deployment.apps/first-service configured
service/first-service unchanged
----

To test out our new endpoint that communicates with the second service, run the below command:

[source, bash]
----
$ minikube service first-service --url
----

Copy the URL, and in another terminal run:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:51793/quote #update the hostname and port
hello from first-service-84ccd864d5-lgmnl, Avast ye landlubbers! Ye can throw ye lunch in Davy Jones‚Äô locker, but not yer homework!
----

Run the curl command a few times to call both pods. 
The code in your first application invokes the HTTP endpoint on the second service to get a random quote.

=== Takeaways

* There are different types of Kubernetes services. You have seen `LoadBalancer` and `ClusterIP`, which are the two you are most likely to encounter. 
A `LoadBalancer` service assigns and exposes an external address. In contrast, a `ClusterIP` only assigns an internal address and ensures only consumers inside the cluster can reach the service's Pods.

* The Kubernetes _Service_ construct is powerful. 
One of the most powerful features is that it creates a stable DNS name for all of your backend Pods so that you do not need to run an additional service discovery component inside Kubernetes.

* A `Deployment` in Kubernetes is a powerful construct that allows the cluster scheduler to upgrade Pods using a `RollingUpdate` strategy safely. New instances of the app are started before older versions are removed.
