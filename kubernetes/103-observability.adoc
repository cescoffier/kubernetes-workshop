= 103 - Observability

In this chapter, we will see how you can make your applications more observable and reliable using health checks and metrics.

== Reminder - Updating applications in Kubernetes

In this chapter, we are going to update our applications multiple times.
First, let's refresh our memories about updating applications.

In general, updating an application is done as follows:

1. Update the code and rebuild using `mvn package`
2. Build the docker image with a new (incremented) tag, like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3...
3. If you are not using minikube, deploy this image to the right image registry
4. Update the `deployment.yaml` file to point to the new tag
5. Kubernetes terminates the existing pods and updates

This process can be a bit cumbersome in development.
So, here is another _smoother_ process, to only use in development with Minikube.

1. Update the code and rebuild using `mvn package`
2. Build the docker image without updating the label - make sure you use the same label as used in the `deployment.yaml` file
3. Remove and reinstall the deployment using:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete deployment $NAME # like first-service or second-service
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
----

Kubernetes deletes the deployment resource.
Following the infrastructure as code principles, it terminates the pods.
The second instruction redeploys the deployment, and create the pods using the updated container images.

Here are the one-line versions for both services:

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean package; docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t workshop/first-service-jvm:1.1 .; kubectl delete deployment first-service; kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

mvn clean package; docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t workshop/second-service-jvm:latest .; kubectl delete deployment second-service; kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
----

Run them from the appropriate directories.

== Health

This section focuses on health checks and how to instructs Kubernetes to restart fallen parts of your system.

=== Adding health

In both services, add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This dependency provides the health check support.
It exposes under `/q/health` the liveness (`/q/health/live`) and readiness (`/q/health/ready`) checks.

By default, it just checks that the application is up and running.

Once added to both services, update the application (following the instructions from above).
When the new applications are deployed and running, check the output of `/health`, `/health/live`, and `/health/ready` for the first service.
To achieve this, access the service and append the url suffixes to the service urls:

[source, bash]
----
$ minikube service first-service --url
http://192.168.49.2:31187
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}%
$  curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health/live


{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}%
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health/ready
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}%
----

The output is always the same because we didn't configure the checks and none of the extensions we are using in the application add any specific checks.

=== Implementing a health check

In this section, we will add a health check to the first application.
This check will contribute to the liveness check.

In the first-service module, create the class `me.escoffier.workshop.MyHealthCheck` in the `src/main/java` source root.
In this class, add the following content:

[source, java]
----
package me.escoffier.workshop;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;

@Liveness // Contribute to the liveness check
public class MyHealthCheck implements HealthCheck { // Implement health check
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() { // Implementation of the check
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("So far so good");
    }
}
----

Then, update the application.

Run the commands, to check the new output:

[source, bash]
----
$ minikube service first-service --url
http://192.168.49.2:31187
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "So far so good",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}%
$  curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health/live
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "So far so good",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}%
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/q/health/ready
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}%
----

As you can see, the check has been added.
Adding checks is essential as, as we will see in the next section, Kubernetes uses them to determine if the application (pod) is alive and ready.

=== Registering health checks in the kubernetes deployment

In this section, we will augment the kubernetes deployment from our two applications to ask kubernetes to check the state of our applications.
Let's start with the first-service.
As we have seen above, the checks are working.

In the `deployment.yaml`, add the health check registration:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: first-service
  labels:
    app: first-service
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: first-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: first-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: first-service
        image: workshop/first-service-jvm:1.1
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
# To be added:
        livenessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 3
          httpGet:
            path: /q/health/live
            port: 8080
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 0
          periodSeconds: 30
          successThreshold: 1
          timeoutSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 3
          httpGet:
            path: /q/health/ready
            port: 8080
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 0
          periodSeconds: 30
          successThreshold: 1
          timeoutSeconds: 10
----

Then, update the application.

**Your turn now**, add the health check registration to the second-service.
No need to implement a custom check, we just want to make sure that the application is up and running.

=== Self-repair

Before going further, make sure you updated the second service with the health check registration.

The second application has a _huge_ flow. The `/crash` endpoint stops the HTTP server of the application.
To verify that the health check have been configured correctly we will stop the application and see if Kubernetes detects the crash and recreates the pod.

In the `MyFirstResource` class from the first service, add the following endpoint:

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Path("/crash")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String crashSecondService() {
    return client.crash();
}
----

This endpoint is just there to let us stop the second service.
Once added, update the first application.

Then, in another terminal window, run:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods -w
----

That gives you an _up to date_ view of our pods.

Invoke the first service `crash` endpoint and see how it behaves:

[source, bash]
----
$ minikube service first-service --url
http://192.168.49.2:31187
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/crash
bye bye
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/crash
bye bye
----

Make sure you call the crash method on all the second-service pods.
Iterate the last command until you get consecutive error messages.

In the other terminal you should see (after ~ 30 seconds):

[source, bash]
----
second-service-8459457fbb-27b5m   0/1     Running   1          2m5s
second-service-8459457fbb-zdnff   1/1     Running   0          2m5s
second-service-8459457fbb-27b5m   1/1     Running   1          2m9s
second-service-8459457fbb-zdnff   0/1     Running   1          2m51s
second-service-8459457fbb-zdnff   1/1     Running   1          3m15s
----

Notice the 3 steps:

1. The pod is seen as not healthy anymore
2. The pod is restarted (restart 1)
3. The pod is ready

Kubernetes has detected the crash thanks to our health check.

To make the check more reactive, update the configuration with:

[source, yaml]
----
livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 1
  httpGet:
    path: /q/health/live
    port: 8080
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 0
  periodSeconds: 5
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 2
----

Update the second service and re-run the experiment.
You should see the restart much faster.

=== Takeaways

Health checks are an essential part of Kubernetes application and Cloud Native applications:

* each component must expose liveness / readiness / startup health checks
* Kubernetes must be configured to restart fallen pods in a timely fashion
* be sure to understand the difference between liveness (I am alive?), readiness (Can I handle request?), startup (Am I ready to serve?)

== Metrics

In this section we will instrument the first application to expose metrics.

=== Micrometer and Prometheus

To expose metrics, we must first add two dependencies.
In the `pom.xml` from the first-service project add the following dependencies:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The first dependency is collecting metrics using the https://micrometer.io/[micrometer] framework, one of the most popular Java alternative.
The second dependency configure the metrics to be exposed using the Prometheus format.

https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is a metrics service collecting and storing metrics.
It's becoming the de-facto standard in the Cloud.
It also provides a minimal dashboard and alerting functionalities.

Prometheus uses _text_ as output/input format.
Each line would be a metrics.

Update the application after having added these dependencies.
Then, query the `/q/metrics` endpoint from the first service, you should get a _big wall of text_:

[source, text]
----
# HELP jvm_memory_usage_after_gc_percent The percentage of old gen heap used after the last GC event, in the range [0..1]

...
----

The response contains:

* metrics about the system (process)
* metrics about the JVM (memory, threads...)
* metrics about the application technical components (http server)

However, that output does not contain business metrics

=== Adding business metrics

Adding business metrics is done using the Micrometer annotations.
In the `MyFirstResource` class, update the content to be:

[source, java]
----
package me.escoffier.workshop;

import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Counted;
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RestClient;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import java.util.Calendar;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;

@Path("/")
public class MyFirstResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Counted("first-service.print.invocations")  // <--- Added to keep track of the number of invocations
    public String print() {
        return "hello from " + System.getenv("HOSTNAME") + ", it's " + now();
    }

    public static final String DATE_FORMAT_NOW = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss";

    public static String now() {
        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
        SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(DATE_FORMAT_NOW);
        return sdf.format(cal.getTime());
    }

    @Inject @RestClient SecondServiceClient client;

    @GET
    @Path("/quote")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Timed("first-service.printWithQuote.time")  // <-- Added to measure the time spent in this method
    public String printWithQuote() {
        return "hello from " + System.getenv("HOSTNAME") + ", " + client.getQuote();
    }


    @GET
    @Path("/crash")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String crashSecondService() {
        return client.crash();
    }
}
----

Update the application and check the `/q/metrics` endpoint.
Invoke the `/` and `/quote` multiple times and check that the metrics are updated.

=== Takeaways

Metrics are essential to detect bottlenecks and anticipate potential cracks and failures:

* instrument all your application with OS, JVM and technical component metrics
* instrument your application with business metrics
* configure a poller mechanism
* build a comprehensive dashboard and set up alerts
* correlate metrics and events - primordial during postmortem

== Configuration

In this section, we are going to configure the second application with a simple _config map_.
This configuration enables/disables a _slow_ mode, that we will utilize in the resilience section.

The _slow mode_ is enabled using the `SLOW` environment property.
We will create a config map containing the configuration and attach this config map to the deployment.
The access to the config map content will be done using environment properties.
For the seek of simplicity, the config map will only contain the `slow` boolean.

=== Creating a config map

First, create the config map as follows:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create configmap second-service-config --from-literal=slow=true
kubectl get configmaps  second-service-config -o yaml
----

The second instruction verifies that the config map is created.

In this example, we create the config map from literals (you can have multiple literals in the create command).
There are other possibilities such as creating config map from files or directly write the descriptor (as printed by the second command).

At this point, we created the config map.
It's time to configure the second-service deployment to read it.

=== Attaching a config map to a deployment

Edit the `deployment.yaml` from the second-service to add the config map:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: second-service
  labels:
    app: second-service
spec:
  replicas: 2
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: second-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: second-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: second-service
        image: workshop/second-service-jvm:latest
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        livenessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            path: /q/health/live
            port: 8080
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 0
          periodSeconds: 5
          successThreshold: 1
          timeoutSeconds: 2
        readinessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 3
          httpGet:
            path: /q/health/ready
            port: 8080
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 0
          periodSeconds: 30
          successThreshold: 1
          timeoutSeconds: 10
# Added:
        env:
          - name: SLOW
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: second-service-config
                key: slow
----

Then, update the application.
Once up and ready, uses the _slow_ service using `/quote` endpoint offered by the first service:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/quote
----

Call the service multiple times and notice the delay in the response (up to 2 seconds).

== Resilience and Fault-Tolerance

In this section, we will extend the first-service to handle the _slow_ second-service.

=== Adding fault-tolerance

First, in the `pom.xml` file from the first-service, add the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-fault-tolerance</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Adding timeout and fallback

The integration point is located in the `SecondServiceClient` interface.
Remember, this _interface_ is a REST Client interface which contain the method to invoke the second service.

Edit the `SecondServiceClient` class to add:

1. a timeout on the `getQuote` method
2. a fallback method

[source, java]
----
package me.escoffier.workshop;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Fallback;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "second-service")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public interface SecondServiceClient {

    @Timeout(value = 1, unit = ChronoUnit.SECONDS) // <---- Added
    @Fallback(fallbackMethod = "getFallbackQuote") // <---- Added
    @Path("/quote")
    @GET
    String getQuote();

    @Path("/crash")
    @GET
    String crash();


    // A simple fallback
    default String getFallbackQuote() {
        return "I am fascinated by air. If you remove the air from the sky, all the birds would fall to the ground. And all the planes, too.";
    }

}
----

Update the first application and call the `/quote` endpoint:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/quote
hello from first-service-868cbcdfb8-kbx4m, I am fascinated by air. If you remove the air from the sky, all the birds would fall to the ground. And all the planes, too.%
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/quote
hello from first-service-868cbcdfb8-kbx4m, I am fascinated by air. If you remove the air from the sky, all the birds would fall to the ground. And all the planes, too.%
$ curl http://192.168.49.2:31187/quote
hello from first-service-868cbcdfb8-kbx4m, A pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever.%
----

Most of the time you will see the fallback quote, as a one-second timeout is probably too short.
Remember that the second service introduces a delay up to two seconds.

=== Retries

_Disclaimer:_ Before using retries, make sure it would not break the integrity of your system.
Only idempotent systems support retry safely.

In addition to the timeout and fallback, let's add a _retry_:

[source, java]
----
@Retry(retryOn = TimeoutException.class,
        maxRetries = 4,
        maxDuration = 10,
        durationUnit = ChronoUnit.SECONDS)
----

Update the application and query the `/quote` endpoints multiple times.
The success rate should be much higher.

=== Circuit Breaker

Remove the `@Retry`, instead, add:

[source, java]
----
@CircuitBreaker(successThreshold = 10, requestVolumeThreshold = 4, failureRatio=0.75,delay = 1000)
----

Update the application and stress the `/quote` endpoint.
What do you observe?

== Monitoring with Prometheus

In the <<_metrics>> section, we exposed metrics.
But, at the moment, nothing collects these metrics.

In this section, we will deploy Prometheus, a popular monitoring framework.
Prometheus _scrapes_ metrics periodically and stores them in as time-series in a database.
In general, you use another tool such as Grafana to build a monitoring dashboard from the stored metrics.
However, for the sake of simplicity, we will only deploy Prometheus.

First, you need Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes.
Follow the instructions from https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/ to install Helm on your system.

Once Helm is installed, run:

[source, shell script]
----
> helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
> helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
> kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-np
----

Access the Prometheus UI using (in a separate terminal):

[source, shell script]
----
> minikube service prometheus-server-np
----

The UI can take some time to appear...
Once available, go to `Status -> Target`.
It lists the configured _targets_, _i.e._, the scrapped URLs.

By default, it does not retrieve the metrics from our applications.
We need to edit the Prometheus configuration and add a _job_.

We need to add the following YAML snippet:

[source, yaml]
----
- job_name: first-service
  metrics_path: /q/metrics
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: pod
    namespaces:
      names:
      - default
    selectors:
    - role: pod
      label: app=first-service
----

We need to edit the `prometheus-server` config map to insert this snippet.
Either:

* use `kubectl edit cm prometheus-server` and edit the config map directly;
* or:

1. retrieve the config using `kubectl get cm prometheus-server -o yaml`,
2. copy the config map into a file,
3. edit the file (**IMPORTANT**: remove the `resourceVersion: "..."` and `uid: ...` lines),
4. apply the updated config map using `kubectl apply -f $FILE`

IMPORTANT: Be extra cautious about the indentation...

Then, go back to the Prometheus UI and verify that the configuration has been changed in `Status -> Configuration`.
If not updated, check your YAML syntax.

Go to `Status -> Target` and wait until the `first-service` endpoints become `UP`.
It can take a few seconds, depending on the scrape configuration. Prometheus collects the metrics from all the replicas and consolidates them.

Now, go into the Graph view, and query some of your metrics, such as `first_service_printWithQuote_time_seconds_count`.

IMPORTANT: Metrics are created lazily, so invoke the endpoint first.
Then, the scrape happens every 60 seconds, so it can take up to 60 seconds to get the value.

=== Takeaways

* Each integration-point, especially synchronous, must be protected against cascading failures and slowness
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance provides an easy way to prevent terrible cracks and failures
* Use `@Timeout`, `@Fallback` and `@CircuitBreaker` when necessary
* Only use `@Retry` if your system permits it.
