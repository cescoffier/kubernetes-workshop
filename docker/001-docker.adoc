= 001 - Docker and Containers

_This workshop is a short introduction to Docker. It's a prerequisite to the Kubernetes workshop_.

This workshop is a set of exercises to get you started and comfortable with Docker. 
The exercises are written to help you learn what Docker does and how it is used to create, share, and deploy containers. 
It does not cover any advanced features such as squashing or `docker-compose`.

== Prerequisites

Be sure you have docker or docker desktop installed.
Follows the instructions from the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker Website] to download, install, and checks your installation.

You can also use:

- Rancher Desktop - https://rancherdesktop.io/
- Podman Desktop - https://podman-desktop.io/

== Running a container 

A container is an isolated process, typically a Linux process: it doesn't see other processes, it has its networking stack, and it has its own filesystem.
However, never forget it shares the resources from the host, especially CPU and memory.

=== Containers are isolated

On your computer, run the following four commands.

[source, bash]
----
$ df
$ pwd
$ echo $HOSTNAME
----

Next, we're going to run a container using the Docker command-line tool.
In particular, you're going to start a new shell inside a container running UBI (Universal Base Image), a Linux distribution tailored for containers.
Once the new shell starts, type those four commands again:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run --interactive --tty registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal /bin/sh
sh-4.4# df
sh-4.4# pwd
sh-4.4# echo $HOSTNAME
sh-4.4# ps 
sh-4.4# exit
----

Compare the output in your terminal to the output from the container, and you'll notice that inside the container, you have:

1. Different mounted filesystems.
2. The working directory is different
3. The hostname is different
4. Some utilities are not available

[NOTE]
====
Look at the image url.
`registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal` is the full url.
`registry.access.redhat.com` is the registry.
`ubi8/ubi-minimal` is the name of the image, with `ubi8` being the _namespace_.
In this URL we omitted the label/tag. 
It will pull the `latest` tag if not specified.
====

=== Containers start quickly

In addition to being isolated, the container will also startup as quickly as a normal process.
The first time you ran that command Docker needed to download the image, which can take some time.
Now that you've got the image cached locally, try running another container:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run --interactive --tty registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal /bin/sh
sh-4.4# echo hello world
sh-4.4# exit
----

You'll notice this time it starts up just as fast as a normal process would.

IMPORTANT: when using orchestrator, computing the placement of the container and downloading the image can take a lot of time.

IMPORTANT: snapshot/restore mechanism can reduce even more the startup time by snapshotting the memory of a container and restoring it.

=== Each container has its own filesystem

Start a container and write some data to a file.

> `-it` is the shorthand for `--interactive --tty`:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal /bin/sh
sh-4.4# echo hello > /tmp/hello.txt
sh-4.4# cat /tmp/hello.txt
hello
sh-4.4# exit
----

Now on your primary terminal, check if `/tmp/hello.txt` exists with the below command:

[source, bash]
----
$ cat /tmp/hello.txt

cat: /tmp/hello.txt: No such file or directory
----

Then start a new container, and check if `/tmp/hello.txt` exists. 
It also should not exist:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal /bin/sh
sh-4.4# cat /tmp/hello.txt

cat: /tmp/hello.txt: No such file or directory
----

As you have now witnessed, containers have unique isolated filesystems. 
The host is not modified by what occurs in the container, and multiple runs of the same Container Image do not result in a shared filesystem.

=== Exercises

You can pass command-line arguments to the process the container runs:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal echo hello world
----

Set environment variables:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -i -t -e HELLO=world registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal /bin/sh
sh-4.4# echo $HELLO
----

Mount a directory from your machine into the container:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -i -t -v $PWD:/host registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal ls /host
----

You can look at the options described in the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[Docker run documentation] to see more ways you can control the container.

=== Takeaways

* You can use `docker run` to run a container.
* A container lets you quickly start an isolated Linux _process_ with its own filesystem and networking stack.
* A container starts with a copy of the base filesystem: changes in one container don't affect other containers.

Next, we'll talk about where this filesystem comes from and how you can create one.

== Packaging an application in an image

Whenever a new container is created, its filesystem is initialized from an *image*.
In the previous section, you were using the `ubi` image, which contains all the files necessary to run.

=== Browsing local images

To see which images are available locally on your machine, run:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker images
----

=== Where images come from

When you ran `docker run registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal` Docker checked if the image was available locally.
If it wasn't available locally, Docker downloads from a remote *image registry*.
The default image registry is the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), which has many pre-existing images available.
However, in our case, we download the image from another registry: `registry.access.redhat`.

You can check https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi-minimal/5c359a62bed8bd75a2c3fba8[the image page] to have all the details you need on the content of that image (Security index, packages...).

=== Tags: versioning images

If you click on the "Tag" button, you'll see a list of tags and when they have been created.
Each tag is a different version of the image.

NOTE: unlike a source repository, image tags can be modified.

When you do `docker run`, you can specify a particular version of the image to load.
For example, here you download and then run version 8.3 of the `ubi-minimal` image:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.5 cat /etc/redhat-release
----

If you don't specify a tag then `latest` is used.
Be aware that once pulled, it never checks if there is a _newer latest_.
That means your locally cached `latest` may be different from the `latest` in the image registry.
In general, do not use `latest`.

=== Creating your own image

You can create your own images, and almost always, you'll want to base your images on an existing one.
Most Linux distributions provide base images on the Docker Hub so that you can use Ubuntu or CentOS as base images.
We'll be building on the `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal` image because it's been tailored for containers.

In a new directory create a file called `HelloWorld.java` with the following contents:

[source, java]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

import static java.lang.System.*;

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String... args) {
        out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
----

In the same directory, create a file called `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.5
# Run a command inside the container as we build.
# In this case, install java and jbang:
# Notice how we chain commands to avoid creating multiple intermediate layers
RUN microdnf install java-11-openjdk-devel unzip  \
  && curl -Ls "https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/releases/download/v0.97.0/jbang-0.97.0.zip" --output jbang.zip \
  && unzip jbang.zip && rm jbang.zip && mv jbang-* jbang && chmod +x jbang/bin/jbang

COPY HelloWorld.java /root

# Set the default command to run when a new container is started with this image:
ENTRYPOINT jbang/bin/jbang /root/HelloWorld.java
----

You can now build a new image, lets called it, very originally, `hello-world`:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker build -t hello-world:1.0 .
----

This is going to take a bit of time, as it needs to install the JVM, JBang and so on.

Once built, you should be able to see the image when you list images:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker images | grep hello-world
----

You can now run new containers using this image:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run hello-world:1.0
----

=== Exercises

1. Skim the documentation for the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[Dockerfile format]
2. Try to package a Java application packaged as a _fat jar_ in a container.
3. Install `dive` (https://github.com/wagoodman/dive/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and inspect the structure of the container image.

=== Takeaways

* Images initialize the filesystem used by a container.
* Images have different versions, addressable using tags.
* Images can be built on top of other images.
* Images can be stored locally or retrieved from a remote registry.
* You can create images using a `Dockerfile` and `docker build`.

IMPORTANT: The images created in this section are not production images. They are used as exercise.

Next, we'll see how you can share your images with others by uploading them to the image registry.

== Pushing images to a registry

Now that you've created an image, it's time to share it with other people.

=== Uploading Docker Hub

First, sign up for a https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub account] or https://quay.io[Quay.io].

In the last section, you tagged your image as `hello-world:1.0`.
Most images in a registry come with a prefix: the name of the user or organization that created them. 
If you signed up as `clement`, your images will be tagged as `clement/<image-name>`.

Rebuild your image with a new tag; don't forget to substitute your Docker Hub username for `clement`:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker build -t clement/hello-world:1.0 .
----

Now you can upload the image to the registry:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker push clement/hello-world:1.0
----

Next, to see that it worked, delete the image from your local cache:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker rmi clement/hello-world:1.0
----

It should no longer be listed in the local list of images:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker images | grep hello-world
----

The image should be retrieved from the registry when you run it:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run clement/hello-world:1.0
----

=== Exercises

In the tutorial above, you used the Docker Hub registry, so everything you upload is public.
Typically, you'll use a registry running in your own environment for performance and have some access control on your images.
Read up on how to run a registry in your own environment:

* https://quay.io/[Quay's registry, available on-premise or as a service]
* https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[AWS Container Registry].
* https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google Container Registry]
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/[Azure Container Registry]
* https://docs.docker.com/registry/[Docker's self-hosted registry]

NOTE: Remember: even though many are called a "Container Registry", they store *images*.

=== Takeaways

* You can upload images to a registry, allowing you to share images with others.
* Your organization will need a registry for its own images.
* Kubernetes provides its own internal registry, but it may not be reachable

=== ARM, x86 and Multi-Archs

In general, containers are using the Linux x86 architecture.
But with the rise of ARM devices (like the Apple M1 / M2), we start seeing inconsistencies.

NOTE: ARM architecture is more efficient in terms of energy consumption pushing major Cloud providers to provide ARM support.

Try run the following images:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it --entrypoint=bash quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-arm64
$ docker run -it --entrypoint=bash quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-amd64
----

What can you observe?

Containers are architecture-specific.
You cannot run a x86 container on an ARM machine without an emulation layer.
The emulation layer, when available, introduces significant latency.

A multi-arch image is an image that can support multiple architectures.
It looks like a single image with a single tag, but it is a list of images targeting multiple architectures organized by a manifest list.
Multi-arch images are compatible with the Docker Image Manifest V2 Scheme 2 or OCI Image Index Specifications.
When you pull a multi-arch images, it selects the one matching your platform architecture.

Run:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker run -it --entrypoint=bash quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17
----

It automatically picks the image for your architecture.

Look at the manifest using:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker manifest inspect quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17
----

You can see that this manifest provides images for amd64 and arm64.

Create a manifest using:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker manifest create quay.io/cescoffier/my-manifest:1.0 \
    quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-arm64 \
    quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-amd64
$ docker manifest annotate quay.io/cescoffier/my-manifest:1.0 quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-amd64 --arch amd64
$ docker manifest annotate quay.io/cescoffier/my-manifest:1.0 quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-graalvmce-builder-image:22.1.0-java17-arm64 --arch arm64
$  docker manifest inspect quay.io/cescoffier/my-manifest:1.0
----

NOTE: if you use podman, replace `annotate` with `add`

IMPORTANT: the listed images must be already available on a registry.

Then, inspect the created manifest.

Push you manifest using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
# Docker:
$ docker manifest push <username>/my-manifest:1.0
# Podman:
$ docker manifest push <username>/my-manifest:1.0 docker://<username>/my-manifest:1.0
----
